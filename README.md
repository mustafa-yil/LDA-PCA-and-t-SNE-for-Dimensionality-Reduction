# LDA-PCA-and-t-SNE-for-Dimensionality-Reduction
This project explores dimensionality reduction techniques on the MNIST dataset using Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and t-SNE. The goal is to visualize the data in 2D and 3D spaces, compare how different techniques project the dataset, and analyze the separability of different digit classes.
