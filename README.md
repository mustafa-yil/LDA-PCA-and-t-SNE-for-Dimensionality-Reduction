# LDA, PCA, and t-SNE for Dimensionality Reduction

## Description

This project explores dimensionality reduction techniques on the **MNIST dataset** using **Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and t-SNE**. The goal is to visualize the data in **2D and 3D spaces**, compare how different techniques project the dataset, and analyze the separability of different digit classes.

## Features

- **Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA):** Projects images using class-based separability.
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):** Reduces dataset dimensions while preserving variance.
- **t-SNE Visualization:** Creates non-linear projections for better separability.
- **Comparison of 2D and 3D projections** using Matplotlib.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Scikit-learn
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Installation

```bash
pip install numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## Dataset

The project uses the **MNIST dataset** and applies dimensionality reduction techniques to visualize different digit classes.

## Project Tasks

1. **Load and Preprocess Data:** MNIST dataset selection.
2. **Apply PCA, LDA, and t-SNE:** Reduce data dimensions to 2D and 3D.
3. **Visualize Results:** Compare different dimensionality reduction techniques.
4. **Analyze Class Separability:** Evaluate how well each method preserves structure.

## Visualizations

- **PCA Projections:** 2D and 3D scatter plots.
- **LDA Projections:** Analysis of class separability.
- **t-SNE Projections:** Non-linear visualization for better clustering.

This project is for educational purposes and follows open-source principles.
